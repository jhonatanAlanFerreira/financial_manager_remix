## About This Project ðŸ“š

This project is created as a learning exercise to dive into Remix with React. The goal is to understand Remixâ€™s core concepts while building a functional web application, which will eventually serve as a portfolio piece.

## Development ðŸ› 

To start the app in development mode, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command launches the application and automatically rebuilds assets when files change.

## Deployment ðŸš€

### Production Build

1. **Build the Project:**

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Start the Production Server:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Choose a hosting provider to deploy your app. For DIY deployments, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready. Make sure to deploy the outputs from the `remix build`:

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

## Prisma Commands ðŸ—„

Manage your database with Prisma using the following commands:

- **Seed Database:**

    ```sh
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

- **Sync Database Schema:**

    ```sh
    npx prisma db push
    ```

- **Generate Prisma Client:**

    ```sh
    npx prisma generate
    ```

## Testing ðŸ§ª

Ensure code quality with these commands:

- **Type Checking:**

    ```sh
    npm run typecheck
    ```

- **Unit and Feature Testing:**

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
